# Psalm 27  

ただ一つ　私の願い求めは  
主の宮に　住まうこと　いのちの限り  

うるわしき主を　仰ぎ見て  
主の宮に住み　主を思う  
うるわしき主を　仰ぎ見て  
主を宮に住み　主を思う  

One thing have I desired of the Lord  
That will I seek after  
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord  
All the days of my life  
To behold the beauty, the beauty of the Lord  
To inquire in His temple, the temple of the Lord  
To behold the beauty, the beauty of the Lord  
To inquire in His temple, the temple of the Lord
