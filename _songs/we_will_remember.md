(Chorus)  
立ち止まり, 振り返り  
Tachidomari, Furikaeri  
思い出す, 主の恵み  
Omoidasu, Shu no Megumi  
ともに, たたえよう  
Tomoni Tataeyo  
変わらぬ主の愛  
Kawaranu Shu no Ai  

(Verse 1)  
我が主、イエス、その御手で  
Waga shu Iesu, Sono Mite de  
私を導かれ  
Watashi wo Michibikare  
喜びと,とこしえの  
Yorokobi to, tokoshie no  
命を与える  
Inochi wo Ataeru  

(Verse 2)  
苦しみと, 悲しみと  
Kurushimi to, Kanashimi to  
痛みの, ただ中で  
Itami no tadanaka de  
主イエスこそ, 道照らす  
Shu Iesu koso, Michi terasu  
まことの光

(Bridge)  
ハレルヤ、ハレルヤ  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
歌え、主なる神に  
Utae, Shu naru Kami ni  
(2 times)  

[Chorus]  
We will remember, we will remember  
We will remember the works of Your hands  
We will stop and give you praise  
For great is Thy faithfulness  

You’re our creator, our life sustainer  
Deliverer, our comfort, our joy  
Throughout the ages You’ve been our shelter  
Our peace in the midst of the storm  

With signs and wonders You’ve shown Your power  
With precious blood You showed us Your grace  
You’ve been our helper, our liberator  
The giver of life with no end  

When we walk through life’s darkest valleys  
We will look back at all You have done  
And we will shout, our God is good  
And He is the faithful One  

I still remember the day You saved me  
The day I heard You call out my name  
You said You loved me and would never leave me  
And I’ve never been the same  

(Bridge)  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
To the one from whom all blessings flow  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
To the one whose glory has been shown
